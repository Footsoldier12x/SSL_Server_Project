# SSL_Server_Project

### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Global Rain’s mission states that “Security is everyone’s responsibility”. Therefore, the implementation of a secure RESTful web application must be accomplished in close partnership with Artemis Financial to protect the organization and its clients.

### What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  Global Rain specializes in secure software utilized by entrepreneurs, businesses, and governments around the world. A web application is vulnerable to attacks from international sources and precautions must be taken to mitigate any breaches, locally or internationally.

### What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  Client’s personal information and records of financial transactions must be kept secure in accordance with the law. For example, personal identifiable information must be secured, or hefty fines can be incurred. 

### How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
	Some of the most commonly know security threats are information harvesting by eavesdroppers on a network, attacker impersonating another user or application, attackers cracking passwords, and the extraction of valuable stored information. Therefore, encryption is critical to mitigate these kinds of attacks.
  Denial of service (DoS), injection, improper input validation, man in the middle, are just some of the potential threats that are commonly used to exploit vulnerabilities in unsecure software today. 
    
### How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  Cryptography and client/server:
The interaction between clients and servers must be secured, specially because of the sensitive nature of the financial information being transmitted. 
    
### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  Dependencies are indispensable tools that facilitate the creation and maintenance of software applications. However, they are also a major vulnerability because these source libraries are utilized without the need for in-depth knowledge of the code within them. It is our job to perform a vulnerability assessment and static tests of known threats, and manually analyze the application for any other unknown threats as well.
    Open-source libraries are a great option for software developers because they are continuously improving and reviewed by many developers, and operating costs are much lower than the alternatives. However, open-source libraries are still vulnerable to logic, syntax errors, and new threats that evolve to bypass mitigation techniques.
    
### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  The attached report can show a small portion of the skills, knowledge, and experience that I have attained during the ssl server project.
